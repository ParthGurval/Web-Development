                <h4>Need for Machine Learning</h4><br>

                The need for machine learning is increasing day by day. The reason behind the need for machine learning is that it is 
                capable of doing tasks that are too complex for a person to implement directly. As a human, we have some limitations 
                as we cannot access the huge amount of data manually, so for this, we need some computer systems and here comes 
                the machine learning to make things easy for us.

                We can train machine learning algorithms by providing them the huge amount of data and let them explore the data, 
                construct the models, and predict the required output automatically. The performance of the machine learning 
                algorithm depends on the amount of data, and it can be determined by the cost function. With the help of machine
                learning, we can save both time and money.

                The importance of machine learning can be easily understood by its uses cases, Currently, machine learning is used in 
                self-driving cars, cyber fraud detection, face recognition, and friend suggestion by Facebook, etc. Various top 
                companies such as Netflix and Amazon have build machine learning models that are using a vast amount of data to 
                analyze the user interest and recommend product accordingly.
